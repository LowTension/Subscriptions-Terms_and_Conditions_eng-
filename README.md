- **Price and Period**: Amount and billing frequency displayed at the point of purchase (monthly, annual, or otherwise).  

### 2. Contract Formation  
By subscribing to our service ("Premium"), you accept these Terms and Conditions and authorize recurring automatic charges to your registered Google Play payment method.  

### 3. Automatic Renewal  
- Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing period at the same price and cycle initially selected.  
- To avoid renewal charges, you must cancel at least 24 hours prior to the scheduled renewal date.  
- Management and cancellation must be processed through your Google Play account:

### 4. Pricing and Billing  
- The amount will be charged to your Google Play account immediately upon purchase confirmation.  
- Applicable taxes will be added according to your country's regulations.  
- Price changes will be communicated at least 30 days in advance; non-cancellation implies continuation at the new price.  

### 5. Cancellation and Refunds
